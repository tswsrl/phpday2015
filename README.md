# TSW @ phpDay 2015
On May 15th and 16th two brave developers went to Verona to attend to phpDay 2015, the biggest event in Italy for PHP developers.

Here you'll find stories about those days.

## TODOS

 1. ~~Sort the `.md` files to match the interventions order~~
 2. Add links, contacts, slides and stuff to all the Markdown files
 3. Format the files in *actual* Markdown
 4. Maybe generate GitHub pages from these files

Doctrine
Rtfm
Orm for oltp on line transaction process
Design entities first how?
Entities have behaviors (have actions and are qualified)
No behavior? No need for orm

Entities should only be valid
Invalid state should be in an indifference state
Avoid setters
Soft delete broken concept
Query functions are better than repository
Avoid 2 phases commits
